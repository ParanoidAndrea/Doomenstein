Meow-sion Impossible: Doom
Game Synopsis: Doomenstein Warrior, who accidentally ran into the tower of Doom, work with a Cat to beat the Ninja Turtles. And the actual master of the tower is...you can find them out yourself:)
Additional Notes: Meow-sion Impossible originally came from my TGP1 game. I "stole" some arts, made by artist Emily Yin, and the idea of the Cat shotting syringe from that game. 
(At the end, Meow-sion Impossible: Doom looks unintentionally like a stealth game so YES I STOLE THE STEALTH IDEA AS WELL)
The model of Ninja Turtle was made by the artist April Chen,as well as some of the animations. Other arts made by myself or from the Internet.

New Game Mode: Dialogue-driven storyline and I made most of the story images to make immersive gameplay experience; Fight with the cat to kill all your enemies.
New Weapon: SMG is the new weapon with the new recoil system, and the recoil amount, recoil duration, recoil force amount can be edited through WeaponDefinition. And I replace the original sprite of the weapons.
New Enemies: Two types of Ninja Turtle: Range Ninja Turtle throws Kama at the player and the cat. Melee Ninja Turtle is functionally similar to Demons. They have new sprites, new animations, which took most of my time to put them into the game.(And they take most of the time loaded into the game lol)
The cat, who always follow the player at a low speed, throw syringe at the enemies on sight.
Some Details: Added screenshake while sprinting; Added damage indicator red screen to player; A new map; Added skybox; Artistically improve the tile......
